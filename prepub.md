**Title:** Regularizing Attention Head Diversity to Improve Specialization and Efficiency in Transformers

**Abstract**
\[To be written last. Summarize the problem, your method (head divergence loss), main results, and impact.]

**1. Introduction**
Transformers have become the backbone of modern deep learning models, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision. A key innovation in Transformers is the use of multi-head self-attention, which is intended to allow the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces. However, studies have shown that attention heads often become redundant, learning overlapping or similar behaviors. This redundancy limits the model's effective capacity and interpretability.

While multi-head attention theoretically allows heads to specialize, in practice, training dynamics often lead to redundancy. Without explicit guidance, many heads collapse into similar behaviors, wasting model capacity. Therefore, adding a diversity-promoting loss is not just helpful â€” it is necessary to guide the model toward more efficient, diverse, and interpretable attention mechanisms.

In this work, we propose a method to explicitly regularize attention heads to become more diverse during training. Our main contribution is the introduction of a loss function that penalizes similarity between attention heads, encouraging them to attend to different parts of the input or learn distinct transformations. We test this idea on a lightweight Transformer model trained on a benchmark dataset and evaluate its effects on performance, training dynamics, and head behavior.

**Contributions:**

* We propose a simple, differentiable loss function to encourage attention head diversity.
* We evaluate the method on \[AG News / CIFAR-10], showing improved convergence and head specialization.
* We provide visual and quantitative analysis to support our findings.

Our work is distinct in that we proactively enforce head diversity *during training*, rather than post-hoc analysis or pruning.

**3. Method**

**3.1 Transformer Overview**
\[Describe the standard Transformer architecture briefly, especially the attention mechanism. Define notation: heads h\_i, attention weights A\_i, outputs o\_i.]

**3.2 Head Diversity Loss**
Let $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times T}$ be the attention matrix for head $i$, where $B$ is batch size, $T$ is sequence length.
We define a cosine similarity loss between each pair of heads:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{div}} = - \sum_{i < j} \text{cosine}(A_i, A_j)
$$

This loss encourages dissimilar attention maps. The final training loss becomes:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{div}}
$$

where $\lambda$ controls the strength of the regularization.

Alternative variants include applying the divergence loss to attention outputs $o_i$ or projection weights $W_i$.

**4.1 Setup**

* Dataset: \[AG News / CIFAR-10]
* Model: \[TinyBERT / MiniViT / custom transformer]
* Baselines: standard training vs. training with head divergence loss
* Loss weight $\lambda \in \{0.01, 0.05, 0.1\}$

**4.2 Metrics**

* Accuracy
* Training loss curves
* Cosine similarity between heads
* Visualization of attention maps

**4.3 Results**

* Table of accuracy vs. $\lambda$
* Training curves comparison
* t-SNE / PCA of head outputs
* Visual attention comparisons

**5. Analysis**

* Discuss differences in head behavior
* Are heads attending to different positions or tokens?
* How does this affect convergence and model confidence?
* Ablation: remove the loss, compare changes

**6. Conclusion**
We proposed a lightweight, effective attention head regularization method that improves diversity and specialization. Our results suggest that regularizing head behavior leads to faster convergence and better performance with minimal computational cost. Future work may explore dynamic $\lambda$, hierarchical head grouping, or combinations with expert-based MoE diversity.
